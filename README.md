# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
Lesson 1 writing prompts.


Variables 
Strings 
Functions (arguments, return) 
if statements 
Boolean values (true, false) 

Variables - Just like in pre-Algebra variables represent and give you a way to refer to data.  Only with Javascript those variables can be just about anything. 

Strings - Strings are a type of variable that hold alphanumeric data.

Functions - Functions hold a group of data (variables and expressions etc) and allow you to easily refer to said data.

If statements tell your script what do to do based on whether or not a statement is true.

Boolean values are simply true or false.  Boolean variables can be used, among other things, to return whether or not a statement is true or false.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3


4. Download this project folder from GitHub.


5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
